# Persian-NER-GUI  

A **graphical user interface (GUI)** for Named Entity Recognition (NER) in Persian text, designed using the **Model-View-Controller (MVC)** structure. Built with **CustomTkinter**, it leverages a **BiLSTM-based NER model** to deliver accurate and efficient entity recognition.

---

### Overview  
This project provides an intuitive graphical tool for recognizing named entities in Persian text. The GUI is built with **CustomTkinter**, while the backend uses a **BiLSTM model** trained on a rich, diverse dataset.

---

### Dataset  
The dataset is a combination of optimized sources, including **Arman**, **Peyma**, and web-scraped data. It contains over **18,600 labeled formal Persian sentences**, making it well-suited for NER tasks.

---

### Features  
- Recognizes Persian names and other entities from input text.  
- User-friendly interface designed with **CustomTkinter**.  
- Powered by a robust **BiLSTM NER model**.  
- Supports three different NER models for comparison and flexibility.

---

### Requirements  
- **Python 3.12** or higher  
- Libraries:  
  - `customtkinter`  
  - `tkinter`  
  - `numpy`  
  - `tensorflow`
